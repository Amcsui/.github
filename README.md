## AMCSUI Collaboration Guideline
Welcome to the GitHub Guidelines for AMCSUI. These guidelines aim to ensure a consistent, organized, and efficient workflow within our GitHub organization.

### Repository Management
- Each repository should have a designated admin responsible for overseeing changes and ensuring adherence to guidelines.
- All proposed changes should be submitted as pull requests for review by the repository admin. This process helps maintain code quality and prevents unintended modifications.
- If the admin is unable to merge a pull request due to technical limitations, a member of the technical team should assist in the process.

### Branching Strategy
- Create a new branch for each specific subject or feature to isolate changes and facilitate easier management.
- After merging a branch, promptly remove it to keep the repository organized and prevent clutter.
- Once a pull request is submitted, avoid adding new commits unless absolutely necessary to maintain focus and prevent conflicts.
- Squash merging is preferred as it combines multiple commits into a single commit, reducing the number of commits in the main branch and improving readability, unless the branch addresses multiple unrelated issues; then consider merging it to avoid fragmentation.

### Commit Guidelines
- Write commit messages using imperative verb forms (e.g., "Add new feature," "Fix bug") to clearly convey the intent of the change. Use the following format for commit messages:
  `If applied, my commit will (INSERT COMMIT MESSAGE TEXT)`
- Keep commit messages short and descriptive, providing a concise summary of the change.
- For projects with multiple scopes, use the "Scope" keyword to indicate the specific area affected by the change, for example:
  `Docs: Fix spelling mistakes in the main tutorial`
- If necessary, include a list of detailed changes starting with a hyphen to provide more context and clarify the modifications, for example:
	\- Fix crashing on startup bug
	\- Update the project structure
	\- ...
- Avoid Ending Sentences with Punctuation
